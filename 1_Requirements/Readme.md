# Requirements
To build python project to do searching for user input data and find that data among multiple excel sheet and combine them to form a new master sheet and display all the data.



## Introduction
In this python project we have to read multiple excel sheet data having 40 rows x 10 column that contain 3 similar column in each sheet i.e. PS number, Name & Email address. Next we have to take the user input for printing the desired student data in a master sheet. Here we are reading the multiple sheet and storing the similar student data into master sheet.

# Features that are integrated in this project are :
* Reading multiple excel sheeet each having 40 rows x 10 column
* Searching methods to search details for user input values
* Combining all the similar data in news master sheet
