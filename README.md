## Folder Structure
Folder             | Description
-------------------| -----------------------------------------
`1_Requirements`   | Documents detailing requirements and research
`2_Design`         | Documents specifying design details
`3_Implementation` | All code and documentation
`4_Test_plan`      | Documents with test plans and procedures

##  Library required for running this project:
|SL No| Library Name  |Operation| Install Library Code|
|--|--|--|--|
|1 | openpyxl |Reading and write excel sheet | pip install openpyxl
|2 | os | Searching the File Path |pip install os_sys

#### Structure to Run the program present in 3_Implementation/src/mainproject.py

* STEP 1 : Run the mainproject.py file
* STEP 2 : Enter your multiple Workbook Path Present in **3_Implementation/DataSheet/** folder in terminal **without quote**  eg:- D:\\Detail_Book2.xlsx
* STEP 3 : Do You Want To Add More Workbook :: Y/N: (# If yes enter multiple path if no go to step 4)
* STEP 4 : Do you want to: A) Search By PS Number : B) Search By User Name : [A/B]? : (Enter Details)
* STEP 5 : Open the Masterfile present at src folder to get output data.

#### Problem statement : Group - 1 miniproject extension
Excel files should be placed in different directories and Master file should get the data from all excel files with respect to user input

## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. Implimenting the library
2. Writing data in mastersheet
3. Creating the database
4. Reading the file path from multiple directory
